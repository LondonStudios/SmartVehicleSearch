# London Studios - Update
Since forming London Studios in April 2020 we've created a number of **high quality** and **premium** resources for the FiveM project, focusing on the emergency services and aiming to bring your server to the next level.

Although we made a number of free resources such as this one in the first year, we've now switched to creating paid content, keeping them constantly updated and working along with providing the best possible support to our customers.

Our **most popular** resources now include *Smart Fires, Police Grappler* and *Smart Hose*.

With **thousands** of **happy customers** we are confident you'll love our resources and our active support team are on hand to help if you have any questions!

# Our store: https://store.londonstudios.net/github
# Our discord: https://discord.gg/nC2krpN

Therefore, this resource is now likely *out of date* and is *no longer supported by us*. The full source code is available should you wish to make any changes. All of our paid resources however are constantly updated and we invite you to take a look!

# SmartVehicleSearch - London Studios
**SmartVehicleSearch** is a **FiveM** resource coded in **C#** enhancing the vehicle search experience. The plugin allows you to set inventories in multiple different vehicles at once, puts you into an animation upon searching and opens all doors whilst searching.

This plugin is made by **LondonStudios**, we have created a variety of releases including TaserFramework, SearchHandler, ActivateAlarm and more!

If you enjoy my plugins, buy me a coffee!

## Usage
**/setvehinv [Inventory]** - Sets the vehicle inventory you are sitting in.
**/clearvehinv** - Clears the vehicle inventory you are sitting in.
**/searchveh** - Searches the vehicle you are facing (you must be outside)

After starting a search, you will be in crouch mode and have the opportunity to walk around the vehicle, the results will come back after 20 seconds and the doors will then promptly close themselves.

## Installation
 1.  Create a new **resource folder** on your server.
 2.  Add the contents of **"resource"** inside it. This includes:
"Client.net.dll", "Server.net.dll", "fxmanifest.lua"
3. In **server.cfg**, "ensure" SmartVehicleSearch, to make it load with your server startup.

## Source Code
Please find the source code in the **"src"** folder. Please ensure you follow the licence in **"LICENCE.md"**.

## Feedback
We appreciate feedback, bugs and suggestions related to SmartVehicleSearch and future plugins. We hope you enjoy using the resource and look forward to hearing from people!
